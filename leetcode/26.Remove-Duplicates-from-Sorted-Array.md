## Description

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

For example,
Given input array nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

## Notes
1. 忘记这是有序数组了
2. 设置两个索引，一个指向数组不重复位置后面一个位置，一个是遍历整个数组的指针。
